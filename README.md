# five-texases
A data visualizing project exploring the politics of a (hypothetically) divided Texas

The code is made up of four .py files:
* charts – contains functions responsible for graphing and annotations;
* utils – contains utility functions, including those that create gifs;
* parsing – contains functions that parse and transform data;
* main – driver file.

The following libraries are required for project's work (the parentheses contain the version used):
* PIL (9.0.1);
* imageio (2.16.1);
* pandas (1.5.);
* matplotlib (3.3.4);
* plotly (4.14.3).
To save the images generated by Plotly, you need Orca or any other alternative.
